    <h1>Blockchain</h1>
    <p>
        A <b>blochchain</b>, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that
        are linked using cryptography.[1][6] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous
        block,[6] a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).
    </p>

    <p>
        By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of its data. This is because once recorded,
        the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent
        blocks. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network
        collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks.
        Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design
        and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. The blockchain
        has been described as "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two
        parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".[7]
